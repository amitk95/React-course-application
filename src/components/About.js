        <p> The advantage of the Coax template is that it's powered by Elementor, a page builder that makes customization easy. Even if you want to keep some of the defaults, though, this template is beautiful, letting the typography and copy take center stage. Ideal for a personal brand, you can choose to layout your content similarly to a resume with big subheads on the left and descriptive text on the right.</p>
